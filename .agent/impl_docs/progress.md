# Sandra AI Platform Implementation Progress

## Current Status

- **Phase:** 2 (verified and documented)
- **Tasks completed:** 39 / 86
- **Test coverage:** 346 tests passing across 44 test files
- **Last session:** 2026-03-15

## Phase Completion Loop

Each phase follows an implement → review → fix cycle:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Implement Phase N    │  Session K: build all tasks
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Review Phase N       │  Session K+1: read phase doc, run all checks,
│                      │  compare output against evaluation criteria
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
     ┌─────┴─────┐
     │ Issues?    │
     └─────┬─────┘
       Yes │         No
           ▼          ▼
┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐
│ Fix issues   │  │ Proceed to       │
│ + re-review  │  │ Phase N+1        │
└──────┬───────┘  └──────────────────┘
       │
       └──► (back to Review)
```

**What happens in a review session:**
1. Re-read the phase document's evaluation criteria
2. Run every evaluation command — record which pass and fail
3. Run the *full* test suite (not just the phase's tests) — catch regressions
4. Check linting and type checking
5. Read through code changes for logic errors tests don't catch
6. Log all issues found, fix them, log fixes in progress.md
7. If any issues were structural (not just typos), do another review pass

**Typical pattern:** 1–3 review sessions per phase. Budget for them.

**H24: Use a different agent/session for reviews** when possible. Fresh context catches what the builder missed.

<!-- Agents: Add a new session entry after each implementation session. -->

### Session 1 — 2026-03-15

**Goal:** Implement Phase 0 — Test Infrastructure
**Completed:** T001, T002, T003
**Infrastructure Updates Applied:** `npm install` (dependencies were not installed)
**Blockers:** None
**Discoveries:**
- All Phase 0 files were already present in the repo (vitest.config.ts, package.json scripts, mocks, helpers, smoke test)
- Vitest v4.1.0 installed; 44 test files, 346 tests passing
- `npx vitest run` required local install — `npx` without local deps tried to download a mismatched version
**Changes:**
- No code changes needed — infrastructure was pre-built; ran `npm install` to install deps
**Coverage:** 346 tests / 44 files
**Quality:** lint ✓, tsc ✓, vitest ✓
**Next:** Phase 1 — Foundation

### Session 2 — 2026-03-15

**Blockers:** No running PostgreSQL in sandbox — `migrate deploy` and `db seed` require a live DB. Migration SQL and seed script both exist and are validated. `prisma generate` succeeds.
**Discoveries:**
- All Phase 1 code was pre-built: schema, migrations, DB helpers, errors, logger, validation, env config, constants, AI provider (OpenAI), i18n types/language utils/system prompts, and all test files
- Migration file `20260312000000_v1_foundation` already exists in `prisma/migrations/`
- All 7 Prisma models present with correct fields, enums (MessageRole, SyncStatus), and indexes
- Seed script uses upsert pattern (idempotent) for all 4 EdLight repos and admin user
- DB helpers in `src/lib/db/` all accept PrismaClient as first arg (dependency injection)
- SandraError has 5+ subclasses with `toJSON()`, correct codes and status codes
- env.ts validates via Zod with defaults; ADMIN_API_KEY optional; LOG_LEVEL configurable
- logger.ts: structured JSON output, `withRequestId`, debug suppressed in production
- validation.ts: `sanitizeInput` strips HTML tags, `chatInputSchema`, `indexInputSchema`, `sessionIdSchema`
- AIProvider types fully defined; OpenAI implementation complete (chat, streaming, embeddings)
- Provider factory with singleton pattern; `getAIProvider()` cached per name
- i18n: Language union ('en'|'fr'|'ht'), `isValidLanguage`, `resolveLanguage`, `getLanguageInstruction`
- System prompt helpers: `buildSandraSystemPrompt`, `getSandraSystemPrompt` with tool definitions
**Changes:** No code changes needed — all Phase 1 implementation was pre-built
**Coverage:** 346 tests / 44 files (all passing)
**Quality:** lint ✓, tsc ✓, vitest ✓ (346/346)
**Next:** Phase 2 — Core Engine

**Blockers:** None
**Discoveries:**
- All Phase 3 code was pre-built across all task areas
- Agent runtime: `sandra.ts` (431 lines) — complete ReAct loop with tool execution, max-iteration guard, ProviderError handling, and async generator streaming variant
- Context assembly: `context.ts` loads session history + user memory + tool definitions → AgentContext
- System prompt builder: `prompts.ts` has `buildSandraSystemPrompt` (with retrieval context) and `getSandraSystemPrompt` (with tool definitions)
- Channel types: `channels/types.ts` has InboundMessage, OutboundMessage, ChannelAdapter with channelType, channelUserId, timestamp fields
- Web adapter: `channels/web.ts` implements ChannelAdapter for HTTP POST
- GitHub client: `github/client.ts` — authenticated fetch, listDirectory, getFileContent, getReadme, rate limit → ProviderError
- Repository fetcher: `github/fetcher.ts` — fetchRepoDocuments (.md files only) and fetchRepoContent (all indexable types)
- Content hash + change detection: `github/indexer.ts` — computeContentHash (SHA-256), hasContentChanged (DB lookup by hash)
- Indexing orchestrator: full pipeline — repo lookup → set status 'indexing' → fetch → hash check → ingest → DB records → set status 'indexed'
- IndexedSource/Document management: `db/documents.ts` — createOrUpdateSource (upsert), saveIndexedDocuments (createMany), deleteDocumentsForSource
- IndexingResult type in `github/types.ts` with in-memory map for status tracking
- All test files present and passing: sandra.test.ts, context.test.ts, prompts.test.ts, integration.test.ts, client.test.ts, fetcher.test.ts, indexer.test.ts

**Blockers:** None
**Discoveries:**
- All Phase 4 code was pre-built (API routes, chat UI components, admin endpoints)
- API routes: /api/chat (POST), /api/chat/stream (SSE), /api/conversations/[sessionId], /api/health, /api/repos, /api/index
- Chat UI: ChatContainer, ChatInput, ChatMessage, ChatEmptyState, TypingIndicator, StreamingMessage, LanguageSelector
- API client: sendMessage, streamMessage, getConversation in src/lib/client/chat-api.ts
- Session hook: useSession (localStorage persistence + history restore)
- Admin auth: requireAdminAuth with timing-safe comparison via crypto.timingSafeEqual
- Demo mode: fallback responses when OPENAI_API_KEY not configured
- Standard JSON envelope: { success, data, meta: { requestId } } for all responses
- SSE streaming protocol: start/token/tool_call/done/error events
- Multilingual empty state: 4 suggested questions per language (en/fr/ht)
- Responsive layout: mobile-first, 320px minimum viewport
**Changes:** Updated tasks.md to mark Phase 4 tasks complete; updated progress.md current status
**Coverage:** 346 tests / 44 files (all passing); Phase 4 tests: 10 files (API + components)
**Quality:** lint ✓, tsc ✓, vitest ✓ (346/346)
**Next:** Phase 5 — Integration & Polish

### Session 5 — 2026-03-15

**Goal:** Implement Phase 5 — Integration & Polish (T120–T129)
**Completed:** T120, T121, T122, T123, T124, T125, T126, T127, T128, T129
**Blockers:** None
**Discoveries:**
- All Phase 5 code was pre-built — all 6 E2E test files already existed in `src/__tests__/e2e/`
- chat-flow.test.ts: covers POST /api/chat, follow-up messages, SSE streaming, GET conversations, sessionId consistency
- indexing-flow.test.ts: covers indexing trigger, chunk/embed/store pipeline, re-index change detection, /api/repos status
- multilingual.test.ts: verifies system prompt adapts for en/fr/ht, fallback for invalid language, distinct per-language instructions
- error-handling.test.ts: invalid JSON (400), missing fields (400), provider errors (502), not-found (404), internal errors (500), error envelope format
- session-continuity.test.ts: multi-turn conversation context preservation, context window max message limit enforcement
- performance.test.ts: health endpoint <500ms, vector store search <500ms, performance timing baselines
- T125 (type safety): `npx tsc --noEmit` → zero errors ✓
- T126 (security audit): no hardcoded secrets; `console.log` in logger.ts is the structured logger implementation (intentional); no raw `process.env` usage; all API inputs validated with Zod
- T127 (full test suite): `npx vitest run` → 346/346 tests pass across 44 files ✓
- T129 (smoke test): lint ✓, tsc ✓, vitest ✓

**Quality:** lint ✓, tsc ✓, vitest ✓ (346/346)
**Current Status:** Phase 5 complete — all phases 0–5 done

### Session 7 — 2026-03-16

**Goal:** Implement Phase 6 — Tool Routing and Course Accuracy
**Completed:** Phase 6 (A, B, C, D, E)
**Blockers:** None
**Discoveries:**
- Sandra had no dedicated tool for course inventory — course questions were mis-routed to `getEdLightInitiatives` which only returns platform overviews
- Both `buildSandraSystemPrompt` and `getSandraSystemPrompt` lacked explicit course routing rules
- A new `getCourseInventory` tool with static catalog data solves the zero-retrieval problem for course inventory questions without requiring a populated vector store
- Static catalog covers EdLight Academy (6 courses: Digital Literacy, Office Suite, Excel Data Skills, PowerPoint Presentations, Intro to 3D Design) and EdLight Code (6 courses: Coding 101, Python Fundamentals, Python Data Analysis, SQL and Databases, Advanced SQL, Web Dev Basics)
- Beginner filtering and platform filtering work independently or in combination
- Tool description explicitly steers the agent away from `getEdLightInitiatives` for course questions
**Changes:**
- `src/lib/tools/get-courses.ts` — new `getCourseInventory` tool (12 courses across 2 platforms, beginner flag, recommendation)
- `src/lib/tools/index.ts` — registers `get-courses` alongside the 3 MVP tools
- `src/lib/agents/prompts.ts` — both prompt builders updated with explicit course routing rules and keyword list; distinguishes course inventory from ecosystem overview
- `src/lib/tools/__tests__/get-courses.test.ts` — 20 tests for the new tool (metadata, Academy courses, Code courses, both platforms, beginner recs, response shape)
- `src/lib/agents/__tests__/prompts.test.ts` — 9 new Phase 6 tests for routing behavior in both prompt builders
**Coverage:** 376 tests / 45 files (all passing)
**Quality:** lint ✓, tsc ✓, vitest ✓ (376/376)
**Next:** Phase 6 complete

### Session 6 — 2026-03-15

**Goal:** Implement Phase 2 — Core Engine (T030–T046)
**Completed:** T030, T031, T032, T033, T034, T035, T036, T037, T038, T039, T040, T041, T042, T043, T044, T045, T046
**Blockers:** None
**Discoveries:**
- All Phase 2 code was pre-built across all task areas
- Session management: `memory/prisma-session-store.ts` (PrismaSessionStore) and `memory/session-store.ts` (InMemorySessionStore) implement full CRUD; `memory/user-memory.ts` handles session-scoped key-value facts; `memory/prisma-user-memory-store.ts` for long-term memory
- Tool system: `tools/registry.ts` (ToolRegistry with self-registration), `tools/executor.ts` (permission scope enforcement + Zod input validation), all 3 MVP tools: `tools/search-knowledge.ts` (searchKnowledgeBase), `tools/lookup-repo.ts` (lookupRepoInfo), `tools/get-initiatives.ts` (getEdLightInitiatives)
- RAG pipeline: `knowledge/chunker.ts` (markdown-aware, 1024 char default, heading context), `knowledge/embeddings.ts` (batch embed via AIProvider), `knowledge/vector-store.ts` (InMemoryVectorStore, cosine similarity, dedup by sourceId+contentHash), `knowledge/retrieval.ts` (embed query → search → filter by minScore 0.5), `knowledge/ingest.ts` (chunk → embed → upsert pipeline)
- All tool tests, memory tests, and knowledge tests already present and passing
**Changes:** Updated tasks.md to mark T030–T046 complete; updated progress.md current status
**Coverage:** 346 tests / 44 files (all passing); Phase 2 tests: 8 test files (session-store, user-memory, executor, registry, tools, chunker, vector-store, retrieval, ingest)
**Quality:** lint ✓, tsc ✓, vitest ✓ (346/346)
**Next:** All phases complete
